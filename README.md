# Checkpoint-Gene-Signatures-Across-Rheumatoid-Arthritis-Stages

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify and characterize immune checkpoint genes across the progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), including the following clinical stages:

- Arthralgia  
- Osteoarthritis (OA)  
- Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (ERA)  
- Undifferentiated Rheumatoid Arthritis (uRA)  
- Established Rheumatoid Arthritis (eRA)  

Checkpoint genes are critical regulators of immune activation, and understanding their expression profiles across RA stages may provide insights into disease mechanisms, potential biomarkers, and therapeutic targets.

## Objectives

- Identify differentially expressed immune checkpoint genes in each RA stage versus normal controls.
- Compare checkpoint gene profiles between RA stages to detect stage-specific patterns.
- Visualize gene expression dynamics and pathway involvement across the RA spectrum.

---

## Data Sources

- **Transcriptomic Data**: Publicly available gene expression datasets (e.g., GEO, ArrayExpress).
- **Clinical Annotation**: Metadata describing RA stage and patient clinical features.

---

## Tools & Methods

- **Data Preprocessing**: R/Bioconductor (e.g., `limma`, `edgeR`, `DESeq2`)
- **Checkpoint Gene List**: Curated from published immunology literature and databases.
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identification of DEGs per stage vs controls.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, volcano plots, PCA, and pathway enrichment analysis.
- **Functional Analysis**: Enrichment using tools such as `clusterProfiler`, `GSEA`, or `ReactomePA`.
- Immune Checkpoints Gene Analysis
- Immune Signature
